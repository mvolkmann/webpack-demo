# This demonstrates using webpack with Babel and Karma.

## Setup steps

* npm install -g webpack
* npm install -g karma
* npm install

## To start the server
```
npm start
```

This does the following:
* starts the webpack-dev-server
* generates bundle.js, but doesn't write it to file system
* serves files
* watches for changes
* does live reload

## To run the tests:
```
npm test
```
